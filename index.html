    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>My name is Ryan Marin, and I am a recent graduate of Princeton University, holding an A.B. in physics. Though my academic focus is in modern theoretical physics, I am also curious about language, metaphysics, AI, and financial markets, a subset of which I occasionally write about on my Substack. 
  If you would like to download my CV, skim my research and academic focus, or connect with me on academic and social platforms, please see the links at the top of this page.</p>
